# KT8-Generic

The Java Generics allows us to create a single class, interface, and method that can be used with different types of data (objects). This helps us to reuse our code.
Note: Generics does not work with primitive types ( int , float , char , etc).

Wildcards can be used in three ways −
Upper bound Wildcard − ? extends Type.
Lower bound Wildcard − ? super Type.
Unbounded Wildcard − ?
